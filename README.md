Ghajini is a place where you can store things that you want to recall in the future, such as an interesting Twitter thread, a great YouTube video link, great youtube thumbnails, your project ideas, your passwords, anything that you want to store in a centralized place and also can share if you wish.

In the future, it would be good for us to create an embedding from this data and allow users to search through their existing data.
