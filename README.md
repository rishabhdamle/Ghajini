**Ghajini** is place where you can store the things that you wants to
recall in the future like a interesting twitter thread, a great you-tube video link,
your passwords, anything that you wants to store it in a centralized place.

In the future, it would be good for us to create embedding from this data
and allow users to search through their existing data.
